    In mathematics and mathematical logic,
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_algebra#Basic_operations">Boolean algebra</a>
    is a sub-area of algebra in which the values of the variables are true or false, typically denoted with 1 or 0
    respectively. Instead of elementary algebra where the values of the variables are numbers and the main operations
    are addition and multiplication, the main operations of Boolean algebra are the conjunction (denoted ∧), the
    disjunction (denoted ∨) and the negation (denoted ¬).
</p>

<p>
    In this mission you should implement some boolean operations:<br>
    - <strong>"conjunction"</strong>
    denoted x&nbsp;∧&nbsp;y, satisfies x&nbsp;∧&nbsp;y = 1 if x = y = 1 and x&nbsp;∧&nbsp;y = 0 otherwise.<br>
    - <strong>"disjunction"</strong>
    denoted x&nbsp;∨&nbsp;y, satisfies x&nbsp;∨&nbsp;y = 0 if x = y = 0 and x&nbsp;∨&nbsp;y = 1 otherwise.<br>
    - <strong>"implication"</strong> (material implication)
    denoted x&rarr;y and can be described as ¬&nbsp;x&nbsp;∨&nbsp;y.
    If x is true then the value of x → y is taken to be that of y.
    But if x is false then the value of y can be ignored; however the operation must return
    some truth value and there are only two choices, so the return value is the one that entails less, namely true.<br>
    - <strong>"exclusive"</strong> (exclusive or)
    denoted x&nbsp;⊕&nbsp;y and can be described as (x&nbsp;∨&nbsp;y)∧&nbsp;¬&nbsp;(x&nbsp;∧&nbsp;y).
    It excludes the possibility of both x and y. Defined in terms of arithmetic it is addition mod 2 where 1 + 1 =
    0.<br>
    - <strong>"equivalence"</strong>
    denoted x&nbsp;≡&nbsp;y and can be described as ¬&nbsp;(x&nbsp;⊕&nbsp;y).
    It's true just when x and y have the same value.<br>

</p>

<p>
    Here you can see the truth table for these operations:
</p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<pre>
 x | y | x∧y | x∨y | x→y | x⊕y | x≡y |
--------------------------------------
 0 | 0 |  0  |  0  |  1  |  0  |  1  |
 1 | 0 |  0  |  1  |  0  |  1  |  0  |
 0 | 1 |  0  |  1  |  1  |  1  |  0  |
 1 | 1 |  1  |  1  |  1  |  0  |  1  |
--------------------------------------
</pre>
</div>

<p>
    You are given two boolean values <strong>x</strong> and <strong>y</strong> as 1 or 0 and you are given an operation
    name as described earlier. You should calculate the value and return it as 1 or 0.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Input: </strong> Three arguments. X and Y as 0 or 1. An operation name as a string.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Output: </strong> The result as 1 or 0.
</p>


<div class="for_info_only">
    <p>
        <strong>Example:</strong>
    </p>
    
<pre class="brush: python">
boolean(1, 0, "conjunction") == 0
boolean(0, 1, "exclusive") == 1
</pre>

</div>

    <strong>How it is used: </strong>
    Here you will learn how to work with boolean values and operators. You even get to think about numbers as booleans.

</p>

<p>
    <strong>Precondition:</strong>
    x in (0, 1)<br>
    y in (0, 1)<br>
    operation in ("conjunction", "disjunction", "implication", "exclusive", "equivalence")
