    <p>“Great!” Exclaimed Sofia. “Now we have the password.”</p>

    <p>“To what exactly?” Quipped Nikola.</p>

    <p>“Untold treasures, vast riches beyond belief! Gold! Silver! Silicon! Hydraulic Fluid! Anything your heart
        desires!”</p>

    <p>“And you’re going to do what with a password to absolutely nothing?” Nikola smirked.</p>

    <p>“Oh... Right...”</p>

    <p>Stephen spoke up. “Well, this door back here has a keypad. Only thing is the brackets look pretty busted up. We
        could try fixing it and then punching in the password?”</p>

    <p>“YES! That!” Sofia exclaimed.</p>

    You are given an expression with numbers, brackets and operators.
    For this task only the brackets matter. Brackets come in three flavors: "{}" "()" or "[]".
    Brackets are used to determine scope or to restrict some expression. 
    If a bracket is open, then it must be closed with a closing bracket of the same type. 
    The scope of a bracket must not intersected by another bracket. 
    In this task you should make a decision, whether to correct an expression or not based on the brackets. 
    Do not worry about operators and operands.
</p>

<p><strong>Input: </strong>An expression with different of types brackets as a string (unicode).</p>

<p><strong>Output: </strong>A verdict on the correctness of the expression in boolean (True or False).</p>

<div class="for_info_only">
    <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<pre class="brush: python">
checkio("((5+3)*2+1)") == True
checkio("{[(3+1)+2]+}") == True
checkio("(3+{1-1)}") == False
checkio("[1+1]+(2*2)-{3/3}") == True
checkio("(({[(((1)-2)+3)-3]/3}-3)") == False
checkio("2+3") == True
</pre>
</div>

    <strong>How it is used: </strong>
    When you write code or complex expressions in a mathematical package,
    you can get a huge headache when it comes to excess or missing brackets.
    This concept can be useful for your own IDE.
</p>

<p><strong>Precondition: </strong><br>
    There are only brackets ("{}" "()" or "[]"), digits or operators ("+" "-" "*" "/").<br>
