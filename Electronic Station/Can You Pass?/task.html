<p>
    If you have solved the
    <a href="http://www.checkio.org/mission/find-friends/share/3061fec1b35588e4bae8ad69db073aab/">
        "How to find friends"</a>
    mission, then you already know how to check for the existence of a path
    in graphs. Let's try to add something more to that problem.
</p>

<p>
    You are given a matrix (2D array) and the coordinates (row and column) of two cells with the same value. The matrix
    consists of digits. You may move to neighbouring cells either horizontally or vertically provided the values of the
    origin and destination cells are equal. You should determine if a path exists between two given cells.
</p>

<p>
    A matrix is represented as a tuple of tuples with digits. Coordinates are represented as a tuple with two numbers:
    row and column. The result should be any value which can be converted into a boolean. If a path exists, then return
    True. Return False if there is none.

<p>
    <strong>Input: </strong>
    Three arguments. A matrix as a tuple of tuples with integers,
    first and second cell coordinates as tuples of two integers.
</p>

<p><strong>Output: </strong>The existence of a path between two given cells
    as a boolean or a value that can be converted to boolean.</p>

    <strong>How it is used: </strong>
    Sometimes we don't need the full pathfinding algorithms implementation and can use
    simplified realisation of these algorithms.
    It can be an useful skill to find a simple ways.
