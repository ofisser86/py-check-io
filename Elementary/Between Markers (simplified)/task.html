<p>
    You are given a string and two markers (the initial one and final). You have to find a substring enclosed between these two markers. But there are a few important conditions.
</p>

<p>This is a simplified version of the <a href="/mission/between-markers/">Between Markers</a> mission.</p>

<ul>
	<li>The initial and final markers are always different.</li>
	<li>The initial and final markers are always 1 char size.</li>
	<li>The initial and final markers always exist in a string and go one after another.</li>
</ul>

<p>
    <strong>Input: </strong> Three arguments. All of them are strings. The second and third arguments are the initial and final markers.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Output: </strong> A string. 
</p>



<div class="for_info_only">
    <p>
        <strong>Example:</strong>
    </p>


<pre class="brush: python">between_markers('What is >apple<', '>', '<') == 'apple'
</pre>

</div>

<p class="for_info_only">
    <strong>How it is used: </strong>
    <i>For text parsing.</i>
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Precondition:</strong>
    <i>There can't be more than one final and one initial markers.</i>
