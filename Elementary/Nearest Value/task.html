<!-- Describe task in general -->

<p>
    Find the nearest value to the given one.
</p>

<p>
    You are given a list of values as set form and a value for which you need to find the nearest one.
</p>

<p>
    For example, we have the following set of numbers: 4, 7, 10, 11, 12, 17, and we need to find the nearest value to the number 9. If we sort this set in the ascending order, then to the left of number 9 will be number 7 and to the right - will be number 10. But 10 is closer than 7, which means that the correct answer is 10.
</p>

<p>A few clarifications:</p>
<ul>
    <li>If 2 numbers are at the same distance, you need to choose the smallest one;</li>
    <li>The set of numbers is always non-empty, i.e. the size is >=1;</li>
    <li>The given value can be in this set, which means that it’s the answer;</li>
    <li>The set can contain both positive and negative numbers, but they are always integers;</li>
    <li>The set isn’t sorted and consists of unique numbers.</li>
</ul>



<!-- Explain input and output values -->
<p>
    <strong>Input: </strong> Two arguments. A list of values in the set form. The sought value is an int.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Output: </strong> Int.
