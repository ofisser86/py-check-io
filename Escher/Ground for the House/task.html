<div class="story for_info_only">
It was a long trip to the island, so you’ve decided to pass the time sitting in the captain's cabin and splitting the treasures remained to be found. Aside from that, a couple of weeks before you left for the expedition, you’ve managed to negotiate with several very wealthy people and approximately knew how much you could get by selling the Hypercube.<br>
<br>
Purchasing land in a picturesque place have been one of your long-held wishes. You’ve dreamed of building a house there and breeding the rare species. All of this requires a considerable amount of money that are likely to come into your possession in the near future.
