<p>
    You are given a string and two markers (the initial and final). You have to find a substring enclosed between these two markers. But there are a few important conditions:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>The initial and final markers are always different.</li>
	<li>If there is no initial marker, then the first character should be considered the beginning of a string.</li>
	<li>If there is no final marker, then the last character should be considered the ending of a string.</li>
    <li>If the initial and final markers are missing then simply return the whole string.</li>
	<li>If the final marker comes before the initial marker, then return an empty string.</li>
</ul>

<p>
    <strong>Input: </strong> Three arguments. All of them are strings. The second and third arguments are the initial and final markers.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Output: </strong> A string. 
</p>



<div class="for_info_only">
    <p>
        <strong>Example:</strong>
    </p>


<pre class="brush: python">between_markers('What is >apple<', '>', '<') == 'apple'
between_markers('No[/b] hi', '[b]', '[/b]') == 'No'
</pre>

</div>

<p class="for_info_only">
    <strong>How it is used: </strong>
    <i>for parsing texts</i>
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Precondition:</strong>
    <i>can't be more than one final marker and can't be more than one initial. Marker can't be an empty string</i>
