    How old are you in a number of days? It's easy to calculate - just subtract your birthday from today. We could make
    this a real challenge though and count the difference between any dates.
</p>

<p>
    You are given two dates as an array with three numbers - a year, month and day. For example: 19 April 1982 will be
    (1982, 4, 19). You should find the difference in days between the given dates. For example between today and
    tomorrow = 1 day. The difference will always be either a positive number or zero, so don't forget about the absolute
    value.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Input: </strong> Two dates as tuples of integers.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Output: </strong> The difference between the dates in days as an integer.

    </p>

    
  <pre class="brush: python">days_diff((1982, 4, 19), (1982, 4, 22)) == 3
days_diff((2014, 1, 1), (2014, 8, 27)) == 238
</pre>

    <strong>How it is used: </strong>
    Python has batteries included, so in this mission youâ€™ll need to learn how to use completed modules so that you
    don't have to invent the bicycle all over again.

<p>
    <strong>Precondition:</strong>
    Dates between 1 january 1 and 31 december 9999.
    Dates are correct.
