<!-- Describe task in general -->

<p>
    In this mission your task is to determine the popularity of certain words in the text. 
</p>

<p>
    At the input of your function are given 2 arguments: the text and the array of words the popularity of which you need to determine. 
</p>

<p>When solving this task pay attention to the following points:</p>

<ul>
    <li>The words should be sought in all registers. This means that if you need to find a word "one" then words like "one", "One", "oNe", "ONE" etc. will do.</li>
    <li>The search words are always indicated in the lowercase.</li>
    <li>If the word wasnâ€™t found even once, it has to be returned in the dictionary with  0 (zero) value.</li>
</ul>


<p>
    <strong>Input: </strong> The text and the search words array.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Output: </strong> The dictionary where the search words are the keys and values are the number of times when those words are occurring in a given text. 
</p>
