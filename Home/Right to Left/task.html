    <p>"For centuries, left-handers have suffered unfair discrimination in a world designed for right-handers."
        <br>Santrock, John W. (2008). Motor, Sensory, and Perceptual Development.</p>

    <p>
        "Most humans (say 70 percent to 95 percent) are right-handed, a minority (say 5 percent to 30 percent)
        are left-handed, and an indeterminate number of people are probably best described as ambidextrous."

    One of the robots is charged with a simple task:
    to join a sequence of strings into one sentence to produce instructions
    on how to get around the ship.
    But this robot is left-handed and has a tendency to joke around and confuse its right-handed friends.
</p>
<p>
    You are given a sequence of strings.
    You should join these strings into a chunk of text where the initial strings are separated by commas.
    As a joke on the right handed robots, you should replace all cases of the words "right" with the word "left",
    even if it's a part of another word. All strings are given in lowercase.
</p>


<p>
    <strong>Input: </strong> A sequence of strings.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Output: </strong> The text as a comma-separated string.

        <strong>Example:</strong>
    </p>
    
<pre class="brush: python">left_join(("left", "right", "left", "stop")) == "left,left,left,stop"
left_join(("bright aright", "ok")) == "bleft aleft,ok"
left_join(("brightness wright",)) == "bleftness wleft"
left_join(("enough", "jokes")) == "enough,jokes"
</pre>

    <strong>How it is used: </strong>
    This is a simple example of operations using strings and sequences.
