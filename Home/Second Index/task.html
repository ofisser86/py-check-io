    You are given two strings and you have to find an index of the second occurrence of the second string in the first one.
</p>

<p>
	Let's go through the first example where you need to find the second occurrence of "s" in a word "sims". Itâ€™s easy to find its first occurrence with a function 


	<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.index">index</a> or <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.find">find</a> 



	which will point out that "s" is the first symbol in a word "sims" and therefore the index of the first occurrence is 0. But we have to find the second "s" which is 4th in a row and that means that the index of the second occurrence (and the answer to a question) is 3.

<p>
    <strong>Input: </strong> Two strings. 
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Output: </strong> Int or None
</p>



<div class="for_info_only">
    <p>
        <strong>Example:</strong>
    </p>


<pre class="brush: python">second_index("sims", "s") == 3
second_index("find the river", "e") == 12
second_index("hi", " ") is None
</pre>

</div>
