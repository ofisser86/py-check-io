    <p>"Look Stephen, here's a list of the items that need to be loaded onto the ship. We're going to need a lot of
        batteries." Nikola handed him a notepad.</p>

    <p>"What are the numbers next to the items?"</p>

    <p>"That is the weight of each item."</p>

    <p>"Er, why?"</p>

    <p>"So you can see how much your trading cards and comic book collection will weigh us down during flight." Rang
        Sofias voice from the phone tube.</p>

    <p>"What is she talking about?” asked Nikola “Ooooh, nevermind, that was sarcasm. It’s important because your
        load-stabilizing belt is broken and there is no way that we can find a new one right now. That’s why, when you
        carry the things on the list, you’ll have to redistribute their weights in order to get the minimal weight in
        each arm."</p>

    <p>"Okay, so I have to figure out how many batteries I should hold in each hand to prevent them from breaking when
        they inevitably fall to the ground. Got it."</p>

    You have been given a list of integer weights.
    You should help Stephen distribute these weights into two sets,
    such that the difference between the total weight of each set is as low as possible.</p>

<p><strong>Input data:</strong> A list of the weights as a list of integers.</p>

<p><strong>Output data:</strong> The number representing the lowest possible weight difference as a positive integer.

    <strong>How it is used: </strong>
    This is a combinatorial optimization version of the partition problem.
    The combinatorial optimization has wide usage and you often see it when you look at automated schedules or route
    calculating.
