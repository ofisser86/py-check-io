<p>
    In this task you you already have the solution. The problem is that it has a bug and you must try to find and fix it.
    "<em>import</em>", "<em>exec</em>" and "<em>eval</em>" don't work for this task.
</p>

<p>
    You are given a string that contains a list with integers or nested lists. 
    The integers could have single plus or minus sign before them.
    If the input string does not contain an array, then raise <strong>ValueError</strong>.
    For an incorrectly formatted string -- raise <strong>ValueError</strong>. Elements of the array are separated by commas.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Input: </strong> A string.
</p>

        <strong>Example:</strong>
    </p>
    <pre class="brush: python">
parse_array("[1, 2, 3]") == [1, 2, 3]
parse_array("[[1], 2, 3]") == [[1], 2, 3]
parse_array("[-3, [-2, 0], 10]") == [-3, [-2, 0], 10]
</pre>

    <strong>How it is used: </strong>
    This task is designed for you to show off your bug hunting skills.
    The parser code itself can be modified and improved to work as part of a larger more complex parsing system.
