<p>
    Tic-Tac-Toe, sometimes also known as Xs and Os, is a game for two players
    (X and O) who take turns marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid.
    The player who succeeds in placing three respective marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal rows (NW-SE and
    NE-SW) wins the game.
</p>

<p>
    But we will not be playing this game. You will be the referee for this games results. You are given a result of a
    game and you must determine if the game ends in a win or a draw as well as who will be the winner. Make sure to
    return "X"
    if the X-player wins and "O" if the O-player wins. If the game is a draw, return "D".

<p>
    A game's result is presented as a list of strings, where "X" and "O" are players' marks and "." is the empty cell.
</p>


<p>
    <strong>Input: </strong> A game result as a list of strings (unicode).
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Output: </strong> "X", "O" or "D" as a string.

    <strong>How it is used: </strong>
    The concepts in this task will help you when iterating data types.
    They can  also be used in game algorithms, allowing you to know how to check results.
