<!-- Describe task in general -->

<p>
As the input you will get the chemical formula and the number N. Your task is to create a list of the chemical elements, which are in the formula in the amount of >= N.<br>
Pay attention, that in the some formulas will be used brackets - () and []. <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_formula'>This article</a> will help you to open the brackets and don't make mistake while counting.
</p>

<!-- Explain input and output values -->
<p>
    <strong>Input: </strong> Chemical formula and the number of atoms.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Output: </strong> List of the chemical elements, sorted in the alphabetical order.
</p>


<!-- Put some usage examples -->
<div class="for_info_only">
<p>
<strong>Example:</strong>
</p>

<pre class="brush: python">
atoms('C2H5OH', 2) == ['C', 'H']
atoms('H2O', 2) == ['H']
atoms('Mg(OH)2', 1) == ['H', 'Mg', 'O']
atoms('K4[ON(SO3)2]2', 4) == ['K', 'O', 'S']
</pre>
