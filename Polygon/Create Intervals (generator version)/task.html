<p>
  From a set of ints you have to create a list of closed intervals as tuples, so the intervals are covering all the values found in the set.<br>
In this mission you should use the 'yield' to make your function a generator.
</p>

<p>
  A closed interval includes its endpoints! The interval <em>1..5</em>, for example,
  includes each value <em>x</em> that satifies the condition
  <em>1&nbsp;<=&nbsp;x&nbsp;<=&nbsp;5</em>.
</p>

<p>
  Values can only be in the same interval if the difference between a value and the next
  smaller value in the set equals one, otherwise a new interval begins. Of course, the
  start value of an interval is excluded from this rule.<br>
  A single value, that does not fit into an existing interval becomes the start- and
  endpoint of a new interval.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Input:</strong>A set of ints.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Output:</strong>A list of tuples of two ints, indicating the endpoints of the interval. The list should be sorted by start point of each interval.
