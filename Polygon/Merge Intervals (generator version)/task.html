<p>
  You are given a sequence of intervals, as tuples of ints where the tuples are sorted by
  their first element in ascending order.<br>
  Your task is to minimize the number of intervals by merging those that intersect or
  by removing  those that are a part of other intervals.<br>
In this mission you should use 'yield' to make your function a generator.
</p>

<p>
  Since the range of values for the intervals is restricted to integers, you must also
  merge those intervals between which no value can be found.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>An example:</strong><br>
  Let's say you've got these 5 intervals: <em>1..6, 3..5, 7..10, 9..12 and 14..16</em>.
  <ol>
    <li>
      <em>1..6 and 3..5</em><br>
      <em>3..5</em> fits into <em>1..6</em>, so <em>3..5</em> must disappear.
    </li>
    <li>
      <em>1..6 and 7..10</em><br>
      Even though the intervals don’t intersect, there isn’t an int type value between them, so they have to be merged with the new interval <em>1..10</em>.
    </li>
    <li>
      <em>1..10 and 9..12</em><br>
      These intervals do intersect, because <em>9 &lt; 10</em>,
      so they have to be merged with the new interval <em>1..12</em>.
    </li>
    <li>
      <em>1..12 and 14..16</em><br>
      These two intervals don’t intersect, so they mustn’t be merged.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <strong>So the intervals to be returned are:</strong><br>
  <em>1..12 and 14..16</em>
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Input:</strong>
  A sequence of intervals as a  list of tuples of 2 ints, sorted by their first element.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Output:</strong>
  The merged intervals as a list of tuples of 2 ints, sorted by their first element.
