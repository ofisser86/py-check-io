<p>
    Let's continue examining words. You are given two strings with words separated by commas.
    Try to find what is common between these strings. The words in the same string don't repeat.

</p>

<p>
    Your function should find all of the words that appear in both strings.
    The result must be represented as a string of words separated by commas in <strong>alphabetic order.</strong>
</p>


<p>
    <strong>Input: </strong> Two arguments as strings.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Output: </strong> The common words as a string.
</p>


<div class="for_info_only">
    <p>
        <strong>Example:</strong>
    </p>


<pre class="brush: python">checkio('hello,world', 'hello,earth') == 'hello'
checkio('one,two,three', 'four,five,six') == ''
checkio('one,two,three',
 'four,five,one,two,six,three') == 'one,three,two'
</pre>

</div>

<p class="for_info_only">
    <strong>How it is used: </strong>
    Here you can learn how to work with strings and sets.
    This knowledge can be useful for linguistic analysis.
</p>


<p>
    <strong>Precondition: </strong><br>
    Each string contains no more than 10 words.<br>
    All words separated by commas.<br>
    All words consist of lowercase latin letters.
