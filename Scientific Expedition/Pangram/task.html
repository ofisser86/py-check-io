<p>
    A pangram (Greek:παν γράμμα, pan gramma, "every letter") or holoalphabetic sentence for a given alphabet is a
    sentence using every letter of the alphabet at least once. Perhaps you are familiar with the well known pangram "The
    quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog".
</p>
<p>
    For this mission, we will use the latin alphabet (A-Z). You are given a text with latin letters and punctuation
    symbols. You need to check if the sentence is a pangram or not. Case does not matter.

</p>


<p>
    <strong>Input: </strong> A text as a string.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Output: </strong> Whether the sentence is a pangram or not as a boolean.
</p>

        <strong>Example:</strong>
    </p>

<pre class="brush: python">check_pangram("The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.") == True
check_pangram("ABCDEF.") == False</pre>

</div>

    <strong>How it is used: </strong>
    Pangrams have been used to display typefaces, test equipment, and develop skills in handwriting, calligraphy, and
    keyboarding for ages.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Precondition:</strong>

<pre class="brush: python">all(ch in (string.punctuation + string.ascii_letters + " ") for ch in text)
0 < len(text)</pre>
