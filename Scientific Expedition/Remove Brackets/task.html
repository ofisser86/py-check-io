<!-- Describe task in general -->

<p>Before solving this mission, you can try to solve the <a href="/mission/brackets/">"Brackets"</a> mission.</p>

<p>
    Your task is to restore the balance of open and closed brackets by removing the unnecessary ones, 
    while trying to use the minimum number of deletions.
</p>

<p>
    Only 3 types of brackets (), [] and {} can be used in the given string.
</p>

<p>
    Only a parenthesis can close a parenthesis. That is, in this expression "(}" - the brackets aren’t balanced. 
    In an empty string, i.e., in a string that doesn’t contain any brackets - the brackets are balanced, 
    but removing all of the brackets isn’t considered to be an optimal solution.
</p>

<p>
    If there are more than one correct answer, 
    then you should choose the one where the character that can be removed is closer to the beginning. 
    For example, in this case  "[(])",  the correct answer will be "()", 
    since the removable brackets are closer to the beginning of the line.
</p>

<!-- Explain input and output values -->
<p>
    <strong>Input: </strong> A string of characters () {} []
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Output: </strong> A string of characters () {} []
</p>
