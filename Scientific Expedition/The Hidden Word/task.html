    <p>DREAMING of apples on a wall,<br>

    Nicola has solved this puzzle (and I am sure that you will do equally well).
    To be prepared for more such puzzles, Nicola wants to invent a method to search for words inside poetry.
    You can help him create a function to search for certain words.

</p>

<p>
    You are given a rhyme (a multiline string), in which lines are separated by "newline" (\n).
    Casing does not matter for your search, but whitespaces should be removed before your search.
    You should find the word inside the rhyme in the horizontal (from left to right) or vertical (from up to down) lines.
    For this you need envision the rhyme as a matrix (2D array).
    Find the coordinates of the word in the cut rhyme (without whitespaces).
</p>
<p>
    The result must be represented as a list -- <strong>[row_start,column_start,row_end,column_end]</strong>, where
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>row_start</strong> is the line number for the first letter of the word.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>column_start</strong> is the column number for the first letter of the word.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>row_end</strong> is the line number for the last letter of the word.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>column_end</strong> is the column number for the last letter of the word.
    </li>
    <li>
        Counting of the rows and columns start from 1.
    </li>

</ul>

    <strong>Input: </strong> Two arguments. A rhyme as a string and a word as a string (lowercase).

<p>
    <strong>Output: </strong> The coordinates of the word.

    <strong>How it is used: </strong>
    This task shows the variance of the positional ciphers.
    With this cipher you can hide a message within a book which allows you and receiver to send these coded messages.

    <strong>Precondition:</strong> The word is given in lowercase<br>
