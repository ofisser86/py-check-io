<!-- Describe task in general -->

<p><i>
    To solve this task you’ll need to create an account on Twilio (it's absolutely free) to get auth_token and account_sid. Here is a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwN-nBFuOEg">short video</a> that will tell you how to do this. In addition, you’ll need to use the WhatsUp API from Twilio. You can <a href="https://www.twilio.com/docs/sms/whatsapp/quickstart">read more about this here</a>.
</i></p>

<p>Oftentimes, when sending a message through WhatsUp, we don’t really bother starting a sentence with a capital letter and ending it with a period. We are in a hurry. But what if the program will correct this for you?</p>

<p>Write a program that will send WhatsUp message with automatically corrected sentences that start with a capital letter, and end with a dot.</p>
